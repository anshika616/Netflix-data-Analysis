# Netflix-data-Analysis (Using Python)

## Project Objective

To analyze the Netflix dataset using Python in order to understand content trends, genre distribution, and release patterns. The objective is to extract meaningful insights through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to support data-driven content decisions.

## Dataset used

- <a href="https://github.com/anshika616/Netflix-data-Analysis/blob/main/netflix.ipynb">Netflix data analysis</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

1- What is the total number of movies and TV shows available on Netflix?
2- How is the content distributed between Movies and TV Shows?
3- Which genres are most common on Netflix?
4- How has Netflix content grown over the years?
5- Which countries produce the most Netflix content?
6- What is the distribution of content ratings?
7- Which directors and actors appear most frequently?
8- What is the average duration of movies and TV shows?
9- How does content availability vary by release year and type?  

## Process 

-Collected the Netflix dataset and loaded it using Pandas.
-Cleaned the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies.
-Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand content type, genres, ratings, and trends over time.
-Used Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing insights like content growth, genre distribution, and country-wise analysis.
-Derived insights by answering business questions based on the visualizations and summary statistics.
